This is a yoga exercise page which is beginner freindly and gives an insight to what yoga is and how it can have a positive affect on your mind and body.

The website has some yoga poses which lets the user try it out at home and then also has join us page which allows them to  join our mailing list which informs them about upcoming classes and some interesting yoga news!

## Testing

### User Testing

- After deploying the site, the website was checked by friends and family on different devices. We did find a problem with the cover text being too close to the right hand side of the page on mobile devices which was fixed later on.

- The website works well on every other device and is responsive to differnt screen size.
